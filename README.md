# Pi in the Sky
This will contain all of my planning and documentation for the Pi in the Sky project.

## Planning
I plan on creating a simple launching device for the pi that will fucntion somewhat like a crossbow, with a bungie cord as a string and a rail for the pi to keep it straight for the start of the flight. [Here](https://github.com/aralsto/Pi_in_the_Sky/blob/master/Planning_Images/mockup.jpg)
is a mockup of this design.
